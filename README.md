This app was created following the walkthrough from Sinatra Up and Running by Alan Harris and Konstantin Haase, published by O'Reilly (2011).

Key Differences:

- Ruby version used
- Bundler used for gem management. Added `rackup` and `puma` for the server configuration. The book suggests using `thin`, but it appeared incompatible with the Ruby and Sinatra versions I am using.
